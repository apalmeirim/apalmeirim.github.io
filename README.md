# Interactive Portfolio

React-powered refresh of my retro-styled portfolio. All of the original aesthetics remain, but the site now runs as a single-page React application with client-side routing and componentised interactions.

## Stack

- React 19 + Vite bundler
- React Router for page navigation
- Matter.js for the contact physics sandbox
- Canvas API for the Scratch Cat mini-game
- Custom fonts served from `/public/assets`

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # local development
npm run build   # production bundle
npm run preview # preview the production build
```
or just visit (link.)[a.palmeirim.github.io]

## Features

- Landing splash that drops you into the main hub.
- Terminal overlay with navigation commands and animated boot sequence.
- Canvas runner mini-game in a modal gate.
- Physics-based contact blocks with gravity toggle and clipboard helpers.
