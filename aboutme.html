                                Hi! My name is <b>Antonio Palmeirim</b>, and I am currently residing in Lisbon, Portugal. I recently graduated from university with a Bachelor's in Computer Science/IT Engineering (<i> 2021 - 2024 </i>), and have since been trying to find my footing and learn things outside of the professional or academic world. I created this website as a first step to introduce myself into the CS world, and become more familiar with web development. It is also to be used as a portfolio for past, current and future projects. To introduce myself personally first, my hobbies are riding motorcycles, watching movies, reading and being creative. I consider myself open-minded and prefer constructive criticism to superficial validity, knowing there is always more to grow. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To begin, three big lessons I learned during my academic journey:
                            </p>

                            <!-- ðŸ‘‡ Clear float before the list -->
                        
                            <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Organization:</strong> The hard part about keeping up with projects and classes wasn't necessarily the difficulty of the subject, but rather the lack of organization. Over the semesters, my colleagues and I formulated plans for projects and began to anticipate work instead of waiting for things to be done. I've learned to be much more patient but equally thorough, keeping my time well spread out, reducing unnecessary pressure or stress.</li>
                                <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> For most of my life I've considered myself well-disciplined. The first year of university proved me wrong, and for the most of my first semester I found myself lazy and underachieving. This mindset soon changed, and since I've become a more disciplined person not only in the interest of others, but also in my own.</li>
                                <li><strong>Fear:</strong> For most of my childhood and my teenage years, fear of failure and asking "dumb" questions has always stopped me from becoming a better me. Due to the independent academic nature of university, I learned to become much more fearless. I began to question, to doubt and to participate in discussion more often, and was rewarded with a greater self-esteem and self-respect.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These are personal conclusions. I am not discrediting all the actual theoritical and practical experience I gained from classes, presentations and group projects, but rather mentioning the deeper personal changes and growth. Now, to showcase my favourite subjects, or ones that I felt had a larger impact on my technical front:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><a href="https://guia.unl.pt/pt/2024/fct/program/1053/course/10640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Database Management:</strong></a> A project that required us to work with multiple concepts of managing data, such as learning the basics of SQL; different data models; relational algebra; data integrity and basic interaction with databases. This class left me keen to seek interest in this area, and data has since become one of my main focuses in CS.</li>
                                <li><a href="https://guia.unl.pt/pt/2024/fct/program/1053/course/11153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Object Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong></a> Class, interfaces, polimorfism and heirarchy were the main focus points. I've always preferred Java, so this class just complemented my already existent interest. </li>
                                <li><a href="https://guia.unl.pt/pt/2024/fct/program/1053/course/8150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Computer Graphics and Interfaces:</strong></a> I was first here introduced to Javascript and gained a broader understanding of how the things I saw on my screen were actually processed and computed. This was a really fun class that peaked a certain interest to learn programming on a more creative perspective.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                To summarize, I have interest in all of the Computer Science world, from artificial intelligence to circuit boards, but I have a sharper understanding and more motivation to learn areas related to <b>data science</b>, <b>cloud computing</b>, <b>digital marketing</b>, <b>web development</b> and <b>cybersecurity</b>. My main goal with this website is to be more independent, disciplined and motivated to create and explore more.
